# Homelab tasks


- I've had an interest in monitoring power usage at my house on a regular base
- Especially wanted to see the impact of my balcony power station
- Multiple options there
    - Directly measure at the solar inverter
    - Add special power monitoring device (E.g. Shelly Pro 3EM)
    - Read the infrared interface of the main power meter
- Let's have a closer look at the latter today
