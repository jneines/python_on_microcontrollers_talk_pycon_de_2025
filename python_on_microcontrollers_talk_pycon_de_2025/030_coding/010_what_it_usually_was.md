Hardware wise a very simple system, like in the good old Computer days (e.g. C64 ;-) ).

- Very, very limited resources to be carefully managed.
Remember the scaler for resources was the **k**.
- Ability to run a single task
- Coding in low level languages: Assembly language, C, ...
- Experience level necessary for having fun: very skilled/expert/senior level
