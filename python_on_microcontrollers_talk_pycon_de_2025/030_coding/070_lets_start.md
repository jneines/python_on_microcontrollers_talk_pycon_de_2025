## Hello world for Microcontrollers

Oh no!

It's not this type of a talk.

No blinking Leds here.

Sorry!

:::{tip} Just two hints:

- Use the [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) website to find a suitable board and how to set it up
- Use [mpremote](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/mpremote.html) to get your code up and running
