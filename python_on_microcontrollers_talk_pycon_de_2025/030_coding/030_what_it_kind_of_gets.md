# What it kind of gets

Very complex piece of hardware with easy access

- Quite capable resources.
Remember the resource scaler was the **M**.
- OS (FreeRTOS, Zephyr, ...) to abstract HW (WiFI, Bluetooth, ...)
- (Multi-)Threading available
- Coding done in high level languages: C++, Rust, ...
- Dedicated IDEs available supporting to implement complex behaviour

- Often provided by the vendor:
Vendor lock-in down the road, but that's a different story.

- Addresses entry level and average users
(Arduino paved the road here)
- Even no-code development platforms exist
- Machine Learning is coming to the Microcontroller

... ***and***

- Python is there :-)
